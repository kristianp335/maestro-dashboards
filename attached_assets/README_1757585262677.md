# Johnson Matthey Liferay Fragment Collection

A comprehensive Liferay fragment collection recreating Johnson Matthey's corporate website using established Vanden implementation patterns and Liferay Classic theme colors exclusively.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete Liferay-native recreation of the Johnson Matthey website (matthey.com) using fragments and client extensions. The implementation features authentic Johnson Matthey branding using Liferay Classic theme colors, responsive design, and improved UX while maintaining compatibility with Liferay's SPA navigation system.

## Project Structure

### Client Extension
The client extension provides global CSS and JavaScript that support all fragments across the site:

```
jm-frontend-client-extension/
├── assets/
│   ├── global.css           # Global CSS with Johnson Matthey branding using Liferay Classic theme tokens
│   └── global.js            # Global JavaScript utilities and shared functionality
└── client-extension.yaml   # Client extension configuration (CSS and JS only)
```

### Fragment Collection
The fragments are deployed separately and contain the complete Johnson Matthey website components:

```
fragment-collection/
└── johnson-matthey-collection/
    ├── collection.json      # Fragment collection metadata
    ├── jm-header/          # Header with navigation, login/search modals, mobile menu
    ├── jm-hero/            # Hero section with video and call-to-action
    ├── jm-news-carousel/   # News and announcements carousel
    ├── jm-share-price/     # Live share price widget with charts
    ├── jm-company-overview/# Company statistics and focus areas
    └── jm-footer/          # Footer with links, social media, newsletter signup
```

### Deployment Architecture

**Client Extensions** (`jm-frontend-client-extension.yaml`):
- Deploy global CSS and JavaScript assets
- Provides foundational styling and utilities
- Uses Liferay's default scoping behavior (no explicit scope required)

**Fragment Collection** (separate deployment):
- Contains all website components as individual fragments
- Each fragment includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and configuration
- Deployed independently to fragment library
- Can be used across multiple Liferay sites
