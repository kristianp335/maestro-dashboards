# Maestro GFD Cockpit Finance Dashboard

## Overview
This project creates a comprehensive Liferay-based finance dashboard for Credit Agricole CIB's Maestro GFD (Global Finance Data) Cockpit. The system provides modular, configurable dashboard components for loan management, deal tracking, risk analysis, and performance monitoring, following CA-CIB's professional banking aesthetic.

## User Preferences
- Use simple, everyday language for communication
- Focus on practical implementation over technical details
- Ensure all fragments are properly editable via Liferay's inline editing system
- Work independently for extended periods without constant check-ins
- Document all architectural decisions and changes with dates
- **CRITICAL**: Always verify ZIP packaging correctness - check that updated code is actually included in generated ZIPs before considering deployment ready

## System Architecture

### Dual-Deployment Strategy

## Headless API Methodology

### Critical Problem Resolution: Blank Fields Issue
**Issue**: Custom fields in Liferay Objects created via the interface appeared blank in API responses and fragment queries, making the dashboard unusable.

**Root Cause**: Objects created through Liferay's web interface lack proper folder organization references, causing field visibility issues in headless API responses.

**Solution**: Complete API-based object creation and data population methodology to ensure full field visibility and proper organization.

### 1. Object Folder Organization
All Maestro objects must be organized under a dedicated folder for proper API field visibility:

```python
# Master folder reference for all Maestro objects
MAESTRO_FOLDER_ERC = "21dc960e-1c90-d476-c009-88ba7f09365a"

# Added to all object-definition JSON files:
"objectFolderExternalReferenceCode": "21dc960e-1c90-d476-c009-88ba7f09365a"
```

### 2. Headless Object Definition Creation
**Critical**: Objects must be created via `/o/object-admin/v1.0/object-definitions` API endpoint, never through the interface.

**Object Creation Process:**
1. **Load Definition**: Parse object-definition JSON with folder references
2. **Create Object**: POST to object-admin API with full definition payload
3. **Auto-Publish**: Immediately publish via `/publish` endpoint to activate
4. **Capture Endpoints**: Store returned `restContextPath` for data operations

**Created Objects (Sept 11, 2025):**
- **MaestroClient** (ID: 197926) → `/o/c/maestroclients`
- **MaestroLoan** (ID: 197973) → `/o/c/maestroloans`
- **MaestroDeal** (ID: 198000) → `/o/c/maestrodeals`
- **GFDActivities** (ID: 198027) → `/o/c/gfdactivitieses`
- **PerformanceKPI** (ID: 198052) → `/o/c/performancekpis`
- **RiskMetrics** (ID: 198076) → `/o/c/riskmetricses`
- **WorkflowMetrics** (ID: 198100) → `/o/c/workflowmetricses`

### 3. Picklist Creation and Mapping
**Banking-Specific Picklists** created for data integrity:

```python
# Client Status Values
CLIENT_STATUS = ["Active", "Inactive", "Suspended", "Under Review"]

# Loan Status Workflow  
LOAN_STATUS = ["Applied", "Under Review", "Approved", "Funded", "Active", "Defaulted", "Closed"]

# Deal Pipeline Stages
DEAL_STATUS = ["Lead", "Qualified", "Proposal", "Negotiation", "Closed Won", "Closed Lost"]

# GFD Activity Types
ACTIVITY_TYPE = ["Credit Analysis", "Due Diligence", "Document Review", "Compliance Check", "Risk Assessment"]

# Risk Rating Classifications
RISK_RATING = ["Low", "Medium-Low", "Medium", "Medium-High", "High", "Critical"]
```

**Picklist Integration**: Each object definition includes picklist field mappings that correspond to realistic banking workflows and CA-CIB operational standards.

### 4. Realistic Banking Data Generation
**Data Scale**: 380 comprehensive records across all financial objects

**Data Characteristics:**
- **50 Major EU Clients**: Airbus, Siemens, Nestlé, ASML, SAP, etc.
- **€75B+ Portfolio**: Realistic loan amounts (€50M-€5B range)
- **Multi-Year Data**: 2021-2025 financial metrics and trends
- **Geographic Coverage**: Pan-European operations (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland)
- **Sector Diversity**: Manufacturing, Technology, Healthcare, Energy, Finance

**Data Structure Per Object:**
- **Client Objects**: Corporate profiles, credit ratings, relationship data
- **Loan Objects**: Terms, amounts, status, collateral, maturity dates
- **Deal Objects**: Pipeline progression, client relationships, revenue potential
- **GFD Activities**: Workflow tracking, origination processes, compliance
- **Performance KPIs**: Revenue, profitability, growth metrics over time
- **Risk Metrics**: Portfolio analysis, credit scores, exposure calculations
- **Workflow Metrics**: Processing efficiency, completion rates, automation

### 5. API Data Population Methodology
**Batch Upload Process** to ensure data integrity and performance:

```python
# Data transformation for each object type
def transform_client_data(client):
    return {
        'externalReferenceCode': client['clientId'],
        'clientId': client['clientId'],
        'clientName': client['clientName'],
        'clientStatus': map_status(client['clientStatus']),
        # ... additional fields with proper mapping
    }

# Batch processing with error handling
def upload_in_batches(data, endpoint, transform_func, batch_size=20):
    for batch in chunks(data, batch_size):
        for record in batch:
            transformed = transform_func(record)
            response = requests.post(endpoint, json=transformed, headers=auth_headers)
            # Error handling and retry logic
```

**Upload Results (Sept 11, 2025):**
- **380/380 records uploaded successfully (100% success rate)**
- **All custom fields now populate correctly in API responses**
- **Dashboard fragments display real banking data**
- **No more blank fields in Liferay interface**

### 6. API Endpoint Discovery
**Critical Learning**: Liferay generates pluralized endpoints that may not match object names:

```python
# Examples of endpoint variations:
"GFDActivities" → "/o/c/gfdactivitieses/"    # Double plural
"RiskMetrics" → "/o/c/riskmetricses/"        # Standard plural
"WorkflowMetrics" → "/o/c/workflowmetricses/" # Double plural

# Best practice: Use restContextPath from object creation response
# Never hardcode endpoint paths
```

### 7. Authentication and Security
**Environment-Based Authentication**:
- Uses `LIFERAY_USERNAME` and `LIFERAY_PASSWORD` environment secrets
- Basic Auth over HTTPS for all API operations  
- No secrets committed to repository
- Production-ready authentication flow

### 8. Validation and Testing
**Post-Upload Verification**:
- API field population confirmation
- Record count validation across all objects
- Custom field visibility testing in both API responses and Liferay interface
- Fragment data binding verification

**Result**: Complete resolution of blank fields issue with 100% data population success rate and full API field visibility.
